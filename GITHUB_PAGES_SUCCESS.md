## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Works on GitHub Pages:
- ✅ Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ✅ Client-side functionality
- ✅ Shopping cart (localStorage)
- ✅ User authentication (client-side)
- ✅ All current features

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ .htaccess files (ignored by GitHub Pages)
- ❌ Server-side PHP
- ❌ Backend API (Node.js)
- ❌ Database connections
- ❌ Server-side processing

**Your .htaccess file:**
- Still in docs/ folder
- GitHub Pages ignores it (no effect)
- Won't cause errors
- Security headers won't apply (GitHub Pages has its own)

---

## 🔒 Security

**GitHub Pages provides:**
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS (SSL certificate)
- ✅ DDoS protection
- ✅ CDN delivery (fast worldwide)
- ✅ Secure by default

**What's missing (from .htaccess):**
- Custom security headers
- Not critical for static sites
- GitHub Pages has built-in security
